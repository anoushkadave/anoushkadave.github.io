`System.out.println("Hello, World! Welcome to my personal website!");`

I am a second-year Computer Science student at UC San Diego in Marshall College. I love *programming*, implementing my vision through *personal projects*, and helping my *community*. Outside of classes, I actively participate in *student organizations* and love *theatre*!
